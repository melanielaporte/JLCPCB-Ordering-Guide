## Introduction
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) is one of the most popular PCB manufacturers, known for its affordable prices and high-quality production. This guide will help you order PCBs easily, whether you are a hobbyist or a professional.


## Step 1: Prepare Your PCB Design Files

To order from JLCPCB, you need **Gerber files** containing the PCB design information.

### PCB Design Tools:
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)
- [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview)
- [Altium Designer](https://www.altium.com/)
- [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/)

### Generating Gerber Files:
1. Design your PCB in the software.
2. Export or generate Gerber files, ensuring the following layers are included:
   - Top and Bottom Copper
   - Solder Mask
   - Silkscreen
   - Drill File (NC Drill)
3. Compress these files into a `.zip` or `.rar` archive.

## Step 3: Upload Gerber Files
1. **Drag and drop** your `.zip` or `.rar` file into the upload section or click "Upload Gerber File."
2. Review the automatically generated PCB preview.

## Step 4: Customize PCB Specifications
Choose the specifications that suit your project.

### Customize Options:
1. **Base Material:** FR4 (default) or custom materials.
2. **Layers:** 1 to 6 (or more if needed).
3. **Thickness:** 1.6mm (standard) or other options.
4. **Solder Mask Color:** Green, Blue, Red, Black, etc.
5. **Surface Finish:** HASL or ENIG.
6. **Copper Weight:** 1oz, 2oz, etc.

 > ## Optional Suggestion: Consider Ordering a Raw PCB in Addition to an Assembled PCB
 > - Raw PCBs are cheaper than fully assembled ones and useful for early-stage testing of layout, connectivity, and fit.
 > - Engineers can manually add or modify components to test new configurations or make quick changes without waiting for a new assembly.
 > - They serve as backups if assembled boards have defects or misplaced components.
 > - Ideal for students or hobbyists, offering hands-on experience in soldering and component placement.
 > - If components are unavailable from the manufacturer, you can source and solder them yourself.
